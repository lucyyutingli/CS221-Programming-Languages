CMSC 22100 Spring 2020: Homework 1

This graded file is for the student with the following cnet: lucyyutingli

===== correctness:

reduce         7 / 8

midpoint       8 / 8

perimeter      8 / 8

meanColor      8 / 8

selectionSort  8 / 8

===== style:

layout              (* no layout points this week -- we know you're new at this *)

clarity        5 / 5  (* i.e., the code can be read by another programmer without extraordinary effort *)

decomposition  4 / 5  (* the code is well organized, helper functions defined where helpful *)

===== total: 48 / 50

Comments:
- In reduce it is unnecessary (and incorrect) to check the
  remainder. For example, consider the fraction 20/10. 20 mod 10 is 0
  but you would reduce such a fraction to 2 / 1 not 1 / 1. If you just
  always return (newnum, newdenom) it should work as expected

- For better orginazation, it would be a good idea to write a distance function to   use in perimeter.
