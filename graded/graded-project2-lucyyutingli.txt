===== correctness:

scans fixed tokens   7 / 8 
scans nat constants  8 / 8 

parses constants                      4 / 4 
parses unary ops (not, pred, isz)     6 / 6 
parses binary ops (and, or, =, >, +)  4 / 6 
parses if                             4 / 4 

desugars nats         6 / 6 
desugars logical ops  6 / 6 
desugars isz          4 / 4 

eval.step    4 / 10
eval.steps   4 /  4
eval.eval    4 /  4

===== style:

layout              (* no layout points, but write beautiful code anyway *)

clarity        5 / 5  (* i.e., the code can be read by another programmer without extraordinary effort *)

decomposition  5 / 5  (* the code is well organized, helper functions defined where helpful *)

===== total: 71 / 80

Comments:
Nice work :)

scan.sml
- You need to raise an error if you scan an invalid token

parse.sml
- In your equals, greater than, and plus cases, you return A.Or instead of the
    appropriate operation

eval.sml
- Your plus cases are not handled correctly. For Plus (Succ x, y) you need to
    check if y is a numval and if so add one to y and subtract one from Succ x. 
    For Plus(x,y), if you cannot step you should return NONE.
- For the Eq and GT cases, when Succ x is involved, you need to make sure that
    x is a numVal rather that stepping on it.
