CS221 Spring 2020: Project 3

This directory contains 15 files, including this README.

In project 3, we build Finagle's successor, which is named Bamboozle.

Bamboozle extends Finagle with unit, pairs, and local
variables. Notably, Bamboozle includes a typechecking phase in order
to preemptively eliminate the possibility of reaching a stuck state
during evaluation.

As before, running "grep todo *.sml" will give you a quick overview of
your tasks for this project. Here is a summary:

scan.sml: enable the scanner to scan variable names. A variable name
always starts with a . and consists of one or more letters, numbers,
and underscores after that. The upcoming item on variables will
address variable name conventions.

desugar.sml: desugar the Xor form

eval.sml: implement step for Pair, Select1, Select2, and Scope

subst.sml: implement subst.

typecheck.sml: implement typeof and lookup for type environments.

Project 3 is due on Wed May 20 by 11:59pm. Have fun!
